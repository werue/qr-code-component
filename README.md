### What I learned

I got myself acquainted with using Figma and Sketch files. It took a lot of experimenting to get the CSS as close to the original as possible. I learned a lot about how to utilize the CSS I had learned about in previous web development courses.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I definitely have a lot to learn if I want to intuitively space out elements. Less code definitely accomplishes more. I would like to learn more about patterns in spacing out elements in a webpage and how to access more of the specific dimensions in a .sketch file.
