## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I got myself acquainted with using Figma and Sketch files. It took a lot of experimenting to get the CSS as close to the original as possible. I learned a lot about how to utilize the CSS I had learned about in previous web development courses.


### Continued development

I definitely have a lot to learn if I want to intuitively space out elements. Less code definitely accomplishes more. I would like to learn more about patterns in spacing out elements in a webpage and how to access more of the specific dimensions in a .sketch file.
